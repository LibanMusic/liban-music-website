        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Liban, a UK-based artist exploring the boundaries of modern music. My sound blends atmospheric synths with heartfelt lyrics, producing a unique blend of R&B and pop. Over the past year I’ve released several singles including Upstage, That You Were There, Summer Girl, Twilight, Without You, Before and Me and You. Each track invites you to step into a new soundscape and feel the emotion behind the music. Stay tuned for more releases.</p>
